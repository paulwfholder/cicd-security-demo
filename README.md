## üéØ What is ReconBot?

**ReconBot** is a modular Python/Bash reconnaissance automation framework that reduces manual security assessment time by **60-80%** through intelligent subdomain enumeration, service detection, and vulnerability scanning workflows.

### Key Features

- üîç **Automated Subdomain Discovery** - Integrates multiple OSINT sources (crt.sh, Subfinder, Amass)
- üåê **Active Service Enumeration** - Port scanning, technology detection, HTTP header analysis  
- üõ°Ô∏è **Vulnerability Assessment** - Integration with Nuclei, Nmap NSE scripts, custom templates
- üìä **Structured Reporting** - Markdown, JSON, and PDF output formats
- üîß **Modular Architecture** - Easy to extend with custom reconnaissance modules
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized** - Concurrent scanning with rate limiting to avoid detection

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# System requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Bash 4.0+
- 4GB RAM minimum
- Linux/macOS (WSL2 for Windows)

# External tools (auto-installed via setup script)
- subfinder
- nuclei  
- nmap
- jq
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/paulwfholder/reconbot.git
cd reconbot

# Run automated setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Verify installation
./reconbot.sh --version
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Single domain reconnaissance
./reconbot.sh -d example.com

# Full scan with vulnerability testing
./reconbot.sh -d example.com --full --output report.md

# Quiet mode with JSON output
./reconbot.sh -d example.com -q --json
```

## üìã Use Cases

### 1. Bug Bounty Hunting
- **Rapid asset discovery** across large attack surfaces
- **Subdomain takeover detection** for quick wins
- **Technology stack fingerprinting** to identify targets

### 2. Security Assessments
- **Client onboarding reconnaissance** for penetration tests
- **Attack surface mapping** for risk assessments  
- **Compliance validation** for external exposure audits

### 3. Continuous Security Monitoring
- **Daily subdomain monitoring** to detect shadow IT
- **Certificate transparency log tracking** for new assets
- **Automated vulnerability baseline** for change detection

### 4. Red Team Operations
- **Initial reconnaissance phase** automation
- **Target profiling** for social engineering
- **Infrastructure enumeration** for attack planning

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration (`config/settings.yaml`)

```yaml
reconnaissance:
  timeout: 300              # Seconds per scan phase
  threads: 10              # Concurrent operations
  rate_limit: 50           # Requests per second
  
subdomain_discovery:
  sources:
    - crt.sh
    - subfinder  
    - amass
  max_depth: 3             # Recursive subdomain levels
  
vulnerability_scanning:
  enabled: true
  severity_threshold: medium  # low/medium/high/critical
  custom_templates: true
  
reporting:
  format: markdown         # markdown/json/pdf
